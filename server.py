"""your-protected-notes — an MCP server that knows WHO is asking.

Your earlier servers answered anyone. This one has two modes:
  guest — no (or missing) token: you share one commons with every guest.
  user  — a verified Neon Auth identity: you get a private shelf.
The difference is one Authorization header, one JWKS check, and one
user_id column. That column is the whole lesson: state only becomes
YOURS when the server can tell who YOU are.

Every design choice has an ADR with the road not taken (docs/adr/) —
including the two we answered BEFORE writing code (0001: identity =
Stack `sub`, never email; 0002: guests share a commons rather than
being refused), which is the deliberative pattern this prototype also
exists to demonstrate.
