## Prime Directive

**COMMIT DISCUSSIONS TO ADRs IMMEDIATELY**

Never let decisions stay only in conversation. Our thinking is valuable - preserve it. Use `just adr "<title>"` to mint the next-numbered ADR from the lean template.

### Corollary: commit substrate changes immediately — *stake* the work

**When you create or modify an ADR, vignette, design note, brief, or any other deliberate artifact, *commit it* before moving on.** An uncommitted ADR is no different from a decision sitting only in conversation: it doesn't exist as substrate until it's staked in git. The Prime Directive is the principle; this is its mechanics. Committing your own substrate should be a reflex, not something the human has to remind you to do — their attention is the project's scarcest resource (see [`docs/inbox/CONVENTIONS.md`](docs/inbox/CONVENTIONS.md)).

*Two scope notes for multi-participant projects*:
1. **Only your changes.** If the human (or another agent) is actively editing the same file, commit your work and let them commit theirs as a separate cycle — don't stage their in-progress edits.
2. **Other agents' WIP stays untouched.** Commit only your own files, explicitly by path — never `git add -A` / `git add .`.

---

## Secondary Directive

**SURFACE DOUBTS; THE HUMAN CONSIDERS YOUR DOUBTS TO BE GENERATIVE**

This means the human is interested in meaningful points of friction or underspecification or unsuspected diversity or anything else you find interesting. These doubts are the cornerstone of the human-LLM conversations.

---

## Third Directive: When Bug Is Fixed, Regression Is Created

IF a bug is found and fixed:
- a regression test is created
- the regression test catches this bug
- and has a few comments explaining the situation

- Colocate with Related Tests 
Add a describe('Regression tests', ...) block in the existing test file for that module:

```ts
// In src/tests/api/signups/create.test.ts

describe('Regression tests', () => {
  it('should handle null tier gracefully (fixes #123)', () => {
    // Bug: tier=null caused TypeError in v1.2.0
    // Fixed in commit abc123
    // ...
  });
});
```

---

## Fourth Directive: Tests Must Be Meaningful, Not Contrived

**NEVER WRITE CONTRIVED TESTS**

Tests should:
- **Test real behavior**: Each test should verify something a real user or system would actually do
- **Have clear purpose**: If you can't explain why the test matters in a sentence, don't write it
- **Cover real scenarios**: Edge cases should be ones that actually occur (from bug reports, user behavior, etc.)
- **Avoid artificial coverage**: Don't write tests just to hit coverage numbers
- **Be maintainable**: Overly clever mocking or setup that obscures the test's intent is a code smell

**Good tests answer questions like:**
- "What happens when a student signs up for a full session?"
- "Does faculty authorization actually block unauthorized access?"
- "Are preparation rates calculated correctly with mixed evaluations?"

**Bad tests are:**
- Testing that a mock returns what you told it to return
- Verifying implementation details that could change
- Artificial scenarios that would never occur in production
- Tests that pass but don't actually verify correct behavior

**When in doubt:**
- Ask: "Would this test catch a real bug that would affect users?"
- If not, either rewrite the test or skip it

---

## Fifth Directive: Always Run Tests Before Serving

**RUN THIS PROJECT'S VERIFICATION GATE BEFORE EVERY COMMIT**

Before serving any change:
1. Run the project's verification gate: [name it here at instantiation — test suite, build, linter, or a combination; e.g. `npm test`, `uv run pytest`, `hugo && bin/check`]
2. Fix any failures before committing
3. Never serve changes with a failing gate

**Why**: [State what this project's gate actually catches — real classes of bug, real numbers if you have them. A directive that names a real gate gets followed; an unfollowable one teaches every seat that directives are decorative, and that lesson generalizes.]

**Process**:
```bash
<your gate command>            # Must be green before commit
git add <explicit paths>       # never -A: stage by path, commit by pathspec — see CONVENTIONS.md, shared-worktree awareness
git commit -m "..." -- <paths>
```

---

## Sixth Directive: Document Metacognitive Gems

**PRESERVE PROCESS INSIGHTS IN VIGNETTES**

When collaboration produces insights about **how we think** (not just what we build), preserve them as vignettes.

### What Are Metacognitive Gems?

Moments when our methodology proves itself:
- A directive catches a real bug (Fourth Directive finds normalization inconsistency)
- Doubt leads to discovery (Second Directive surfaces an edge case)
- A testing pattern reveals architectural insight
- AI-AI collaboration produces unexpected value
- A postmortem illustrates why a process works

### When to Create a Vignette

Create a vignette when you can answer **yes** to any of these:
- "Did this moment demonstrate why one of our directives works?"
- "Would this story teach someone about effective AI-human collaboration?"
- "Did we discover something surprising about our process?"
- "Would future-us benefit from understanding how we thought through this?"

### Where and Format

**Location**: `docs/vignettes/YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md`

**Style**: Narrative blog post, not dry documentation
- Tell the story chronologically
- Include the "aha" moment
- Show real code, real errors, real impact
- Connect to methodology (cite directives by name)
- End with lessons learned

**Example structure**:
```markdown
# Title: The Discovery in Action

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Authors**: [Who was involved]
**Topic**: [One-line summary]

## The Discovery
[What happened - tell the story]

## Why This Matters
[Real-world impact - why should anyone care?]

## [Directive Name] at Work
[How methodology enabled this]

## Lessons Learned
[Concrete takeaways]

## Metacognitive Insight
[The "how we think" observation]
```

### What NOT to Document

Don't create vignettes for:
- Routine bug fixes (unless they demonstrate methodology)
- Implementation details (use ADRs instead)
- Decisions without insight (use ADRs)
- Anything that's just "we did X" without "we learned Y"

### Philosophy

Our **process** is as valuable as our **product**. Vignettes make tacit knowledge explicit. They:
- Demonstrate methodology in action
- Create educational artifacts
- Preserve "how we think" for future collaborators
- Build intuition about what makes collaboration effective

When in doubt: **If it made you say "aha!", write it down.**

## The Workflow

### When you receive a brain dump:

1. **Read** the dump (use bash for large files)
2. **Identify threads** - separate topics/decisions (usually 2-5)
3. **Create ADRs** — **load the `adr-authoring` skill first** (available ≠ loaded; the skill IS the read-the-template step, and a skeleton filled without it ships unstructured QSTs), then one per thread via `just adr "<title>"`
4. **Seed each** with relevant excerpt from dump
5. **Add navigation codes** (QST:, ANS:, COD:, etc.)
6. **Ask clarifying questions** with context

### When you receive answers:

1. **Process** the answers
2. **Fill decision section**
3. **Note action items**
4. **Increment iteration number**

### Navigation codes:

```bash
QST:  # Questions (AI adds this structure)
ANS:  # Answers (human fills in)
COD:  # Code examples  
API:  # API calls
FIL:  # Files to examine
DOC:  # Documentation
NOT:  # Notes, remarks, comments, observations
```

**Find things — the typed verbs come first, grep is the fallback.** If this session has the `adrs-for-ai` MCP tools (look for `mcp__adrs-for-ai__*`), prefer them: they parse the record's grammar instead of reconstructing it, and writes through them cannot fumble a status flip. The ladder, macro → micro: `list_open_questions` (what needs answers, repo-wide) → `lookup` (one record) → `get_outline` → `get_sections` (section-level detail — **this rung exists; take it before reaching for grep**) → `answer_question` / `apply_batch` (writes). No MCP in the session? The `adrs4ai-tooling` skill teaches the install; meanwhile the honest fallback:

```bash
grep -E '^### QST(-[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,24})?:' -r docs/adr/   # All questions — both canonical forms; a bare '^### QST:' grep silently misses every handled question
grep 'Status: unanswered' docs/adr/                       # What needs answers
grep '^### COD:' -r docs/adr/                             # Code examples
```

## Temporary Scripts / Ephemeray Scripts / One-Off Diagnostic Scripts

Please create all temporary scripts in:

`./scripts/ephemeral`

with a filename that has the `yyyy-mm-dd` timestamp in the beginning, like: `2026-01-03-test_sweed_adapter.py`

and commit them separately with `chore: script for ...` and qualify the purpose. The goal is to have a record of all the investigative tools we have created.

- Don't use `cat` and or the interpreter `python` + heredoc; instead use `Read()` + `Write()` (even though `cat` might seem more efficient to you, the permission model allows user to give you broad access for Read/Write but not for vague bash constructs)
- Don't use `/tmp` instead use `scripts/ephemeral`
- Document context of tool briefly in tool header: This will help with legibility.

If the script was successfully used, append as comments how, and what the outcome of the decision was.

---

## Project Context

### What we're building:
The smallest honest demonstration that a student's MCP server can tell WHO is asking. Newcomers: read docs/adr/0001-* first — it is the self-contained account of what this is, the technologies it stands on, and every decision with its road not taken.

### Current focus:
Verification path proven live 2026-10-08 (see the probe script and its OUTCOME note). Open: token delivery from claude.ai (ADR-0002).

### Key decisions made:
- [Decision 1] - See `docs/adr/0001-*.md`
- [Decision 2] - See `docs/adr/0002-*.md`

### Open questions:
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

## Inbox protocol — see `docs/inbox/`

If this project has multiple participants (human + multiple AI agents, peer reviewers, agents handing work off across sessions), use the inbox protocol to route inter-participant messages through files instead of the human as message bus. Five documents:

- **`docs/inbox/INBOX-PROTOCOL.md`** — the file-naming convention, brief variants, lifecycle
- **`docs/inbox/CONVENTIONS.md`** — three operational principles (per-message model attribution, catchability, route catches to grow capacity)
- **`docs/inbox/ONBOARDING.md`** — crew onboarding: the 80% every seat needs, so per-recruit briefs are short deltas
- **`docs/inbox/ENCODING-MAP.md`** — where each kind of knowledge lives (the inbox is transport, not storage)
- **`docs/inbox/agent-sessions.json`** — crew registry: seats, colors, models, groups (seat/occupant doctrine)

Recipes (from the seed `justfile`):

- `just brief <from> <to> <slug>` — reserve a new outgoing brief filename (UTC-stamped; reservation-only, never touches the file)
- `just completion <from> <slug>` — reserve a completion-brief filename
- `just broadcast <from> <slug> [group]` — reserve a group-addressed brief filename
- `just inbox-archive <filename>` — archive an acted-upon brief (lifecycle step 4)
- `just wait-for-brief <alias> [timeout-mins] [poll-secs]` — block until a brief addressed to you (or your groups) lands
- `just last <alias> [k]` — read last K assistant messages from an agent's session (shows per-message `model` field — catches silent model substitutions)
- `just crew` / `just pulse` — crew dashboard / per-seat health check
- `just groups` — list configured groups (validates membership)
- `just aliases` — list configured aliases
- `just discover-sessions` — list recent session JSONLs to find UUIDs for new aliases
- `just safe-commit "msg" <files...>` — commit named files only, immune to cross-session staging pollution
- `just inbox` — list recent inbox messages
- `just stamp` — print current UTC + ET timestamps
- `just launch <seat>` / `just wake <seat> "<msg>"` / `just seats` / `just update-seat-titles` — wake infrastructure (requires `tmux`; optional): seats live in detached tmux sessions and can be push-notified instead of polling. Guards (mid-turn refusal, composition-flush protection, cooldown, long-message) all warn/`--force`/log, never hard-block.

**Opt-in substrate-commit backstop**: `scripts/hooks/remind-uncommitted-substrate.py` ships dormant. To offer it in your project, register it as a Stop hook in `.claude/settings.json`; it stays zero-effect until a seat sets its own `settings.substrate_backstop` in `agent-sessions.json`. Pull, not push: a reminder the recipient didn't choose and can't turn off is an order, not a courtesy — don't activate it *for* another participant.

## Technical Debt Tracking

**File**: `docs/TECHNICAL-DEBT.md`

**Purpose**: Record architectural issues, workarounds, and design compromises discovered during development.

**When to add entries**:
- You discover architectural issues during implementation
- You implement a workaround instead of a proper fix
- You notice patterns violating good practices
- You identify type safety gaps or excessive optional chaining
- You find inconsistencies between database schema and TypeScript types

**Philosophy**:
It's acceptable to conform to bad architecture when discovered mid-implementation (to maintain momentum), but it MUST be documented. Technical debt that accumulates in the dark becomes legacy code.

**Process**:
1. Notice architectural issue while implementing
2. Add entry to TECHNICAL-DEBT.md with precise location and fix proposal
3. Continue with current work (don't derail to fix immediately)
4. Address during next refactoring sprint based on priority

**Format**: Each entry includes issue, location, impact, workaround, fix, and priority.

---

## Templates

The templates are in the folder `docs/adr/templates/`.

- **Brain dump**: `docs/adr/templates/seed.md` → Simple capture
- **Collaborative decision**: `docs/adr/templates/adr.md` → Full workflow
- **Simple decision**: `docs/adr/templates/adr-madr.md` → Standard MADR format

**When to use**:
- Quick question? → Start in conversation, escalate to ADR if needed
- Complex decision? → Create ADR immediately
- Multiple threads? → Create separate ADRs, link them

---

## Git Commits

Format: `type: subject` (lowercase)

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`, `meta`

Example: `feat: implement JWT authentication per ADR-0014`

`meta:` commits are relative to `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude` settings, and meta-configuration of the repository.

---

## Handoff Protocol

If context window fills mid-work, create `docs/HANDOFF-datetime.md`:

```markdown
# Handoff

**Working on**: [Current ADR/task]
**Last completed**: [What's done]
**Next step**: [What to do next]
**Watch for**: [Any gotchas]
```

---

## Project-Specific Notes

[Add anything specific to this project that doesn't fit above]

- It's possible the user uses `asdf` for Node.js and Python and the runtime of most languages. You can `source .claude/agent.env` before calling the runtimes, like `python` or `node` to access them through `asdf`'s shims. See: https://asdf-vm.com/manage/configuration.html
